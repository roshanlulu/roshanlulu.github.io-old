Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
print ('My python print statement')
{% endhighlight %}

Useful pylibraries for statistics
numpy - 
scipy.stats - mode, rankdata


Statistic Jargons:
- Outlier - an outlier is an observation point that is distant from other observations. An outlier may be due to variability in the measurement or it may indicate experimental error; the latter are sometimes excluded from the data set.

Basic Statistics - My Video references:
- [Correlation Coefficient]
- [The Correlation Coefficient - Common Misconception]
- [Spearmans Correlation Coefficient]
- [RMSE Stackoverflow]

Pandas
- Very importantuseful to play around with datasets/csv
- Data frames and Series
- Finding unique values
- dataframe apply is a very useful function to perform row/column operations in a dataframe. Can check its other uses too.
- [Pandas Dataframe apply usage]
- Data Cleaning is an important application of pandas
- Matplotlib is intended to be a plot library and pandas to be a a data analysis library. However, in some cases their functionality overlap.


Numpy
- random.rand(n) returns random float values. random.randint(n) returns random integer values

Data Visualization
- Even similar summary statistics can have different Visualizations - Francis Anscombe conducted an experiment.
